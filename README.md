Performed Java Task Again with proper IDE setup
CICD Pipeline for Handling Positive Integers
This project demonstrates the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for a Java program that handles two positive integers. The program calculates specific outputs based on the sum of these integers.

Requirements
GitHub repository
Java program
JUnit for testing
GitHub Actions for CI/CD
SonarQube for code quality analysis (optional)
Program Logic
If the sum of the integers is greater than 100, the program outputs the sum.
If the sum of the integers equals 100, the program outputs the product.
If the sum of the integers is less than 100, the program outputs the positive difference.
Steps to Follow
Write the Java Program: Implement the program logic in Java. You can use ChatGPT if you are not comfortable coding from scratch.

Write Test Cases: Use JUnit or any other testing framework to write test cases for the program logic.

Create a CI/CD Pipeline: Use GitHub Actions to create a CI/CD pipeline that runs the test cases automatically every time the code is checked in. The pipeline should also generate a test report.

Add SonarQube Analysis (Optional): For bonus points, you can add SonarQube analysis to the pipeline to get a code quality score.

Submission Guidelines: Once the pipeline is set up and the code is ready, upload it to your GitHub repository. Include a README file and share the repository link: https://github.com/YaseenKhan699/Task_02.git with the evaluator.
